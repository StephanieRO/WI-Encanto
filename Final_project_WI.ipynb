              "'Encanto is a 2021 American computer-animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. The 60th film produced by the studio, it was directed by Jared Bush and Byron Howard, co-directed by Charise Castro Smith, who co-wrote the screenplay with Bush, and produced by Yvett Merino and Clark Spencer, with original songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\\n\\nStarring the voices of Stephanie Beatriz, MarÃ­a Cecilia Botero, John Leguizamo, Mauro Castillo, Jessica Darrow, Angie Cepeda, Carolina GaitÃ¡n, Diane Guerrero, and Wilmer Valderrama, the film follows a multigenerational Colombian family, the Madrigals, led by a matriarch whose children and grandchildrenâexcept for Mirabel Madrigal (Beatriz)âreceive magical gifts from a miracle that helps them serve the people in their rural community called the Encanto. When Mirabel learns that the family is losing their magic, she sets out to find out what is happening, and save her family and their magical house.\\n\\nThe film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 3, 2021, and was released in the United States and Canadian theatres on November 24 over a 30-day theatrical run in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It grossed over $250 million worldwide against a $120â150 million budget, and achieved wider commercial success when released onto Disney+ on December 24, 2021. Its soundtrack went viral and reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and UK Compilation Albums charts; \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" and \"Surface Pressure\" were two of its most successful songs, with the former topping both the US Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart for multiple weeks.\\n\\nUpon release, Encanto received critical acclaim for its characterization, music, animation, voice acting, emotional depth, and cultural fidelity. Various reviews named magic realism and transgenerational trauma as the film\\'s core concepts. Encanto has received several accolades, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film, and the National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film. At the 94th Academy Awards, the film has been nominated for Best Animated Feature, while its score and track \"Dos Oruguitas\" contend for Best Original Score and Best Original Song, respectively.\\n\\nPlot\\n\\nthumb|right|Madrigal family from left to right: Luisa, Isabela, Alma, Mirabel, AgustÃ­n, Julieta, Camilo, Antonio, Pepa, FÃ©lix, and Dolores.\\nAn armed conflict forces Pedro and Alma Madrigal, a young married couple, to flee their home village in Colombia with their infant triplets Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. The attackers kill Pedro, but Alma\\'s candle magically repels them, creating the sentient Casita for the family to live within an encanto, a magical realm bordered by high mountains. Fifty years later, a new village thrives under the candle\\'s protection and its magic grants \"gifts\" to each Madrigal descendant at the age of five which they use to serve the villagers. However, Bruno, vilified and scapegoated for his gift of precognition, disappeared ten years earlier, while Julieta\\'s youngest daughter, 15-year-old Mirabel, had mysteriously received no gift.\\n\\nOn the evening when 5-year-old Antonio gains the ability to communicate with animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking and the candle\\'s flame flickering, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita appears undamaged to the others. After overhearing Alma praying, Mirabel resolves to save the miracle\\'s magic. The next day, she talks to her super-strong older sister Luisa, who confesses to feeling overwhelmed by her near-constant obligations then suggests that Bruno\\'s room, in a forbidden tower in the Casita, may explain the phenomenon. There, Mirabel discovers a cave and barely escapes it with some pieces of a slab of opaque emerald glass in hand. Outside, Luisa discovers that her gift is weakening. After her family reminds her why Bruno is vilified, Mirabel reassembles the glass, and see a picture of the Casita cracking behind her.\\n\\nLater that evening, Mirabel\\'s oldest sister Isabela, who can make plants and flowers grow at will, is scheduled to become engaged to neighbor Mariano GuzmÃ¡n. Amidst Mariano\\'s proposal and an awkward dinner, Dolores, who possesses superhuman hearing, reveals Mirabel\\'s discovery to everyone, causing the Casita to crack again, ruining the night and Mariano\\'s proposal when the weather-controlling Pepa inadvertently conjures a downpour. Amidst the chaos, Mirabel follows a group of rats and discovers a secret passage behind a portrait where she finds Bruno who reveals he never left the house and that he broke the vision to save Mirabel. Using Antonio\\'s room, Bruno reluctantly conjures another vision which initially resembles the previous one, along with Mirabel embracing Isabela.\\n\\nMirabel reluctantly apologizes to Isabela, who abruptly confesses that she does not want to marry Mariano and is burdened by her image of perfection. Mirabel helps Isabela develop her powers and the two embrace, but Alma sees the pair and accuses Mirabel of causing the family\\'s misfortunes out of spite for not having a gift. Mirabel finally snaps at Alma, blaming her overbearing nature for weakening the family\\'s magic. This argument creates a fissure that splits a nearby mountain and demolishes the Casita as the candle extinguishes, leaving the Madrigals powerless.\\n\\nSeveral hours later, Alma finds a tearful Mirabel back at the river where Pedro died and explains her tragic backstory and how, determined to preserve the magic, she ignored how her own expectations were harming the family and finally accepts responsibility for what happened.

Howard and Bush subsequently revealed that after finishing Zootopia (2016), they knew they wanted their next project to be a musicalâwhich turned into a Latin-American musical after Miranda came on board.  Howard and Bush had already worked on buddy films \"where two characters go out into the world and learn about each other\" and wanted to try something \"completely different.\"  The three men discussed their common experience of having large extended families, and decided to make a musical film about a large extended family with a dozen main characters. \\n\\nDuring the five years it took to develop the film, Howard and Bush\\'s \"true north\" was the theme of perspective, \"about how you see the other people in your family and how you\\'re seen.\" They began by brainstorming ideas on a whiteboard. Early on, they made \"three important discoveries\" about families which became the basis of the film\\'s story: \"1) most of us don\\'t feel truly seen by our families, 2) most of us carry burdens we never let our families see, and 3) most of us are oblivious that nearly all of us, especially within our own families, feel the exact same way\". In turn, it was Miranda who suggested that the \"vibrant, broad spectrum\" of Latin-American music could \"best capture\" the complexity of family relationships.\\n\\nEarly in development, the production team spoke with many therapists and psychologists. All were asked who would be treated best by the parents in a four-person family; every answer differed. Bush concluded: \"It\\'s about how you perceive yourself in the family.\" The crew also consulted family members and Disney Animation people.\\n\\nHoward and Bush started to discuss Latin-American culture at length with Juan Rendon and Natalie Osma, who had previously worked with them on the making-of documentary Imagining Zootopia.  Rendon and Osma both happened to be from Colombia and repeatedly drew upon their personal experiences with Colombian culture in their discussions, which caused Howard, Bush, and Miranda to focus their research on that country.  Rendon and Osma became the first two of several cultural experts hired by Disney Animation as consultants on the film, who collectively formed what Disney called the \"Colombian Cultural Trust.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, Rendon and Osma accompanied Howard, Bush, and Miranda on a research trip to Colombia.  During their two weeks in the country, they met with architects, chefs, and artisans to immerse themselves in the country\\'s culture.  They also visited the Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez foundation. They visited big cities like BogotÃ¡ and Cartagena, but they found inspiration in small towns such as Salento (terrain) and Barichara (architecture).  Bush noticed that \"every town we went to had a very specific personality\", because of how the country\\'s mountainous terrain divides and isolates them.  According to Disney fan club publication Disney twenty-three, this isolation became the key to placing the Madrigals\\' residence in a \"remote \\'encanto\\'âthat is, a place that\\'s \\'charmed,\\' or spiritually blessed, a domain where magic and reality merge\". As Espinosa Uribe explained, Colombians are surrounded by \"sacred lands that feel magical, and we coexist with them, not questioning their existence\". In Barichara, they befriended a local tourist guide, Alejandra Espinosa Uribe, who showed them around the town, and later hired her to consult on the film\\'s historical and cultural authenticity.  Espinosa Uribe was an inspiration for several aspects of the film\\'s protagonist Mirabel, including her curly black hair, large eyeglasses, and gestures. The design of Mirabel\\'s skirt was inspired by traditional skirts woven in the VÃ©lez area.\\n\\nThe final version of the film is deliberately vague as to the timeframe in which it is set, but drew inspiration from early 20th-century Colombia.  After exploring the 1950s, the directors decided to shift the look of the film to the early 1900s and to use a \"folkloric Colombian aesthetic\". At the beginning of the 20th century, the country endured the Thousand Days\\' War, which resulted in the populations of entire villages fleeing to save themselves as depicted in the film.\\n\\n Writing \\nAs the film steadily became more complex, with an entire family to develop, multiple songs, and a rich cultural setting with a deep tradition of magical realism, Howard and Bush realized they needed a second screenwriter to help write the screenplay.  They selected Charise Castro Smith for her strong background in magical realism and experience with handling \"real-world family dynamics\". Bush described her as a \"godsend\", as she provided \"a foundation of heart, vulnerability and authenticity\". Castro Smith sought to create a distinct, imperfect, and completely human character in Mirabel, one that spoke to the lives of many Latinas while also being relatable to viewers globally.\\n\\nFrom working on Moana, Miranda knew that film\\'s protagonist, Moana, originally had eight brothers before they were removed to streamline the film\\'s plot.  As Miranda had expected from that experience, Disney Animation initially resisted moving forward with a dozen main characters for Encanto. Miranda deliberately wrote the film\\'s opening number, \"The Family Madrigal\", to prove to Disney Animation that it was possible to efficiently introduce such a large family and its internal dynamics to the audience. Because of the film\\'s 90-minute runtime, the filmmakers struggled to make the center family feel genuine, fleshed out, and human, and to give them arcs. The crew worked hard to develop Encanto upon instantly identifiable family archetypes. The team focused on pushing past the archetypes and showing that family members are more complicated than the\\xa0\"masks\" imposed on them. Each member of the Madrigal family is inspired a common family archetype if it were exaggerated and made magical; for example, Isabela and Luisa are based on that of the golden child and rock, respectively. Bush explained that this method prevented each gift from feeling arbitrary, instead being prescribed by emotions and personality.\\n\\nLike most Disney Animation films, Encanto went through \"many different versions\" in its development, as various story ideas were explored and discarded. The ideas discarded along the way include: a young modern-day woman is transported by a magical doorknob to another world; AgustÃ­n was the family patriarch who discovered the encanto and personally built the Casita there; the film would have been expressly set in the 1950s and featured cosmopolitan and modern fashions, as well as motor vehicles and a trip to the big city where Alma had originally come from; the Casita was an extension of only Alma\\'s personality, rather than the entire family; the film would have followed the story of multiple generations and the Casita over a 100-year timespan; Mirabel was desperately trying to find her magical gift, rather than merely expressing frustration with not being granted one; the colors of Mirabel\\'s world as seen from her perspective would have reflected her emotional state as she narrated the first two acts, and then changed over to more realistic colors when the film shifted to Alma\\'s point of view in the third act; Luisa\\'s room would have been made out of stone and appeared \"boring\" to reflect her sense of responsibility, but would have concealed a \"secret exit\" to a hidden room similar to a \"theme park\" where she could have fun; and Isabela at one point had a \"dorky\" suitor named Bubo who came from the big city.  After the film\\'s release, Bush revealed via Twitter several more ideas which had been discussed and set aside: Alma gave birth to the triplets at the river, at the moment of Pedro\\'s death; Isabela and Mirabel\\'s mutual hostility culminated in a fistfight; and Mirabel celebrated her quinceaÃ±era. According to Howard, as the plot evolved over several years, \"the core of the whole film\" was always the relationship between Mirabel and Alma.\\n\\n Casting \\nDisney cast several actors with Colombian heritage, including Stephanie Beatriz, whose father is Colombian; John Leguizamo, who was born in BogotÃ¡; and Wilmer Valderrama, who spent his childhood in Colombia, where his mother is from.\\n\\nAnimation\\n\\nEncanto was the \"hardest film\" to date for heads of animation Renato dos Anjos and Kira Lehtomaki because they were asked to fully develop a dozen characters, as opposed to other animated films which primarily feature two or three characters out of a large cast.  The animators were challenged by the directors to make Mirabel distinctively different from all prior Disney heroines; she had to be both capable and imperfect, but not merely just clumsy.  The Casita was inspired not only by traditional Colombian homes but films in which houses come alive, especially Beetlejuice (1988).\\n\\nThe production team learned in their research that music, dance, and rhythm are core elements of everyday life in Colombia.  As a result, Encanto was the first Disney Animation film to have choreographers involved in the development process from start to finish, meaning they worked closely with the production team to develop songs, characters, and story.  This is in contrast to older films where the story was already in place by the time a choreographer was hired to consult on specific scenes.  For Encanto, Disney Animation initially hired African-American choreographer Jamal Sims, who insisted on immediately hiring Colombian-American dancer Kai Martinez as the film\\'s animation reference consultant.  They worked together with a team of dancers to prepare choreography reference footage for each scene, and then gave feedback to the animators on scenes as they were animated.  They developed different dance styles for different characters; Luisa\\'s style is reggaeton, while Mirabel\\'s style is Cali salsa.\\n\\nFor selection and animation of the plants and flowers that Isabela could make grow, the production team consulted with Colombian botanist Felipe Zapata. His advice allowed appropriate plants to be selected and then shown in accurate detail. The river of jacarandas and strangler figs and the cascade of sundew that Isabela produces are all based on this input. Plants in the background scenery are also realistic. These included the iconic, but now vulnerable wax palm and dramatic Cecropia trees. Economically important plants, like coffee, also appear.\\n\\nOver 800 people, 108 of them animators, were involved in the production of Encanto.  Disney Animation was planning to send many of its animators to Colombia starting on March 15, 2020 in preparation for the film\\'s transition from development to production.  This second research trip had to be cancelled after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The studio\\'s animators ended up having to work remotely with the Colombian Cultural Trust; for example, Espinosa Uribe gave the animators a virtual tour of Colombia with the help of her cell phone. Guerrero sent the studio\\'s designers photographs of Colombian food taken by her relatives in Colombia.\\n\\nOn June 22, 2020, Miranda confirmed on Good Morning America that he and Bush were working on an animated Disney film set in Colombia, with Bush and Byron Howard directing, and Charise Castro Smith co-directing.\\n\\nOn June 18, 2020, the tentative title was revealed to be Encanto. The project was also confirmed to be the film Miranda was involved in, and it was reported to be about a girl in a magical family. While initial reports had said the film would be set in Brazil, Miranda stated on June 22 that it would actually be set in Colombia. The same day, it was also reported that Castro Smith would be a co-director in addition to co-writing the screenplay. On December 10, 2020, the project was officially confirmed at a Disney Investor Day meeting, where a clip was shown, a fall 2021 release was announced, and magical realism was referenced. According to Bush, development of the film\\'s script wrapped in August 2021, and production on the film wrapped a month later.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many crew members worked together remotely for over a year and did not meet each other in person until Disney put on a socially-distanced outdoor screening of the final version of the film.\\n\\nCinematography\\nEncanto is the first Disney Animation film since Tangled (2010) to employ a tall frame, a decision made to \"get closer to the characters\". This layout was supplemented by romanticism lighting. According to Howard, romantic (meaning heightened in spirit) is the film\\'s key word in terms of the approach towards cinematography and lighting. The latter was also inspired by magic realism, due to the genre\\'s heavy influence on the writing and characters. The directors aimed to use the film\\'s optics to portray strong emotions; Alessandro Jacomini and Daniel Riceâdirectors of cinematography, lightingâstated this use \"would amplify, exaggerate, and distort perception, which is very in line with Mirabel\\'s point of view as a narrator\". Her feelings of being left out were also shown using emotive lighting. The directors frequently reminded the crew of the emotional subtext\\xa0of every\\xa0scene as well as the intricacies of the individual parts. That subtext was applied\\xa0by Warner, Jacomini, and Rice in elaborate\\xa0sequences, such as the song \"Surface Pressure\".\\n\\nSoundtrack\\n\\nIn June 2020, Miranda publicly revealed that he had begun to write the film\\'s music, which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English. After the film\\'s premiere, he disclosed that he had been writing songs for the film from the very beginning. On September 8, 2021, Germaine Franco, co-composer of the songs for Coco (2017), began to score the film. The soundtrack was released on November 19, 2021 and reached number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming the first Disney soundtrack since that of Frozen II (2019) to top the chart. The track \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" was a viral sensation. It broke various records and became one of Disney\\'s most successful songs of all time. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, and marked Disney\\'s first number-one song on the former in the 21st century and its first-ever on the latter.\\n\\nRelease\\nMarketing\\nThe first look of the film was shown on December 10, 2020, during Disney\\'s Investor Day. The teaser trailer was released on July 8, 2021 as the official trailer was released on September 29, 2021.\\n\\nIn October 2021, Jakks Pacific announced it would release a new line of toys for the film. The new Funko Pop! figures of several characters from the film are available for pre-order and they started shipping in January 2022.\\n\\nFor its opening weekend at the box office, Disney spent $14 million on television advertisements to promote the film, generating 1.26 billion impressions. Deadline Hollywood said the marketing failed to distinguish the film from other Disney properties, causing audience members to believe that it would be similar to Coco.\\n\\nTheatrical\\nDisney held the film\\'s world premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 3, 2021, and also held a Colombia premiere at the Teatro ColÃ³n in BogotÃ¡, Colombia on November 23, 2021. The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 24, 2021, in RealD 3D and Dolby Cinema. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film had an exclusive 30-day theatrical run before being released on Disney+ on December 24, 2021. The film was paired with the short film Far from the Tree. Encanto was released in China on January 7, 2022. On February 16, 2022, the film was re-released in cinemas after its success on Disney+ and Academy Award nominations.\\n\\n Home media \\nEncanto was released on Disney+ on December 24, 2021, and was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on February 8, 2022. Bonus features include \"Letâs Talk About Bruno\", \"Our Casita\", \"Journey To Colombia\", \"Familia Lo Es Todo\", \"A Journey Through Music\", and a sing-along version of the movie. Far from the Tree was also released alongside the film on streaming on physical media.\\n\\nSince its Disney+ release, Encanto has consistently topped Nielsenâs weekly streaming chart, most recently with 1.4 billion total minutes of viewing.\\n\\nReception\\n\\n Box office \\n, Encanto has grossed $95.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $154.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $250.3 million. Encanto was 2021\\'s highest grossing animated film before it was surpassed by Sing 2. Factoring in both the film\\'s production budget and marketing expenses, along with the theaters\\' share of revenues, Encanto was estimated to need to gross at least $300 million worldwide to break-even. Nevertheless, the film went viral over the 2021 holiday season and achieved wider commercial success after its digital release to Disney+ on December 24, 2021.\\n\\nIn the United States and Canada, it was released alongside House of Gucci and Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, and originally projected to gross $35â40\\xa0million from 3,980 theaters in its five-day opening weekend. It opened nationwide on Wednesday, November 24, 2021 (the day before American Thanksgiving), and made $7.5 million on its first day, including $1.5 million from Tuesday night previews. It went on to make $40.6 million in its first five days. Of the 3.7 million moviegoers who saw it, 52% were Latino and Hispanic, 51% were families, and 62% were female. Though its five-day opening gross was lower than Pixar\\'s The Good Dinosaur (2015) ($55.4 million), which failed at the box office in 2015, Encanto had the best opening weekend for an animated film during the COVID-19 pandemic. In its second weekend, it made $13.1 million, less than the second weekend results of The Good Dinosaur ($15.3 million) and Tangled (2010) ($21.6 million) but higher than The Princess and the Frog (2009) ($12.1 million). It went on to finish in second place in its third and fourth weekends, earning $10 million and $6.5 million respectively. In its fifth weekend, it made $1.8 million and dropped to ninth place at the box office. In its sixth weekend, it finished in tenth place with $1.08 million. It dropped out of the box office top ten in its seventh weekend, finishing eleventh with $613,501.\\n\\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, it made $29.3 million from 47 markets in its opening weekend; the top countries in its first five days were France ($3.5 million), Colombia ($2.6 million), the United Kingdom ($2.4 million), Korea ($2.2 million) and Italy ($2.1 million). It earned $20.7 million in its second weekend and $13.6 million in its third. In its fourth weekend, it became Colombia\\'s second highest-grossing animated film of all time. In its fifth weekend, it crossed the $100 million mark outside the U.S. and Canada. It earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend, $5.8 million in its seventh, and $3.6 million in its eighth. As of January 9, 2022, its largest markets are France ($18.5 million), Colombia ($10.2 million), the U.K. ($8.8 million), Spain ($7.3 million), and Japan ($6.6 million).\\n\\nCritical reviews\\n\\nEncanto has garnered critical acclaim. News channel CNBC reported reviewers considered it among Walt Disney Animation\\'s best films.   Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an 88% positive score, with 70% saying they would definitely recommend it.\\n\\nThe film\\'s animation, which journalists considered beautiful, was a source of plaudits. RogerEbert.com critic Monica Castillo thought the musical sequences and characters\\' rooms allowed animation more artistic and abstract than that of previous Disney films. Writing for Good Morning America, Peter Travers deemed the visuals of Encanto miraculous, while Shreemayee Das of Firstpost described the animation as having spellbinding intricacy. Likewise, Variety Owen Gleibermam gave acclaim, saying \"Encanto has been visualized with a vivacious naturalistic glow (swirling flower petals, eye-candy pastels) that, at moments, is nearly psychedelic\". David Rooney from The Hollywood Reporter highlighted the film\\'s colors and the designs of the costumes, natural settings, and Casita for particular praise. For IndieWire, Kristen Lopez lauded the visuals as stunning and life-like; IGN Andrea Towers agreed, calling the animation beautiful. The Daily Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin was particularly amazed: \"Encanto animation is dazzling in all sorts of ways, with technical effects and flights of creative fancy that would have been unimaginable even a year ago, particularly during the musical numbers.\"\\n\\nCritics found the film\\'s songs \"spellbinding\". According to Ben Travis of Empire, the songs once again demonstrate Miranda\\'s abundant skills for enchanting, wondrous melodies and lyrics. For Chicago Sun-Times and the Daily Herald, respectively, Richard Roeper and Dann Gire described the music as \"infectious and instantly memorable\", and \"emotionally distilled [and] verbally nimble\"; The Detroit News writer Adam Graham agreed, commenting that the songs \"lift [Encanto] to the sky\". Similarly, The Arizona Republic Bill Goodykoontz regarded them as the film\\'s peak. CNN writer Brian Lowry shared a similar view. Nevertheless, many journalists found fault with the music, such as National Review Kyle Smith, who called it \"thuddingly mediocre\". Though he found the songs \"breezy and fun\", Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly deemed them unmemorable. Writing for Bleeding Cool, Kaitlyn Booth believed the music was \"[no]thing particularly special\" and that a lack of songs would have benefited the film.\\n\\nReviewers singled out Encanto representation and diversity for particular praise. Writing for The Guardian, Simran Hans found the\\xa0awareness of culturally unique generational trauma and displacement intriguing and surprising. Despite being critical of a perceived disguise of cultural representation, Rafael Matomayor of The New York Observer stated that \"when the film dives into the specificity of its portrayal of Colombia[,]\\xa0... it becomes an exciting, nuanced, complex magical realist adventure\" that propels Disney into \"a new era\". The Independent Clarissa Loughgrey highlighted that the cultural specificity was more than simple aesthetic or linguistic references, commending the incorporation of magical realism and various skin tones. Whelan Barzel of Time Out summarized the film as a \"genuine love letter to the diversity of Latin America\".\\n\\nReviews with regards to the film\\'s portrayal of family dynamics deemed the aspect one of its strengths. According to Slant Magazine Derek Smith, Encanto thrives in expressing not only the typical message of the value of family but also the concept that even the best families require much effort to stay intact. Preston Barra of Denton Record-Chronicle named the message of family a contributing factor to the film becoming a \"must-see family event\"; fellow journalist Matt Goldberg, who writes for Collider, commended the message of \"[being] enough because family is enough\". Polygon Petrana Radulovic found the familial interactions stunningly realistic and strengthened by magical metaphors. Many critics also acclaimed Encanto emotional depth. The A.V. Club Caroline Siede lauded the depiction of intergenerational trauma. According to Screen International critic Tim Greierson, when the directors concentrate on the script\\'s underlying emotions, the film is extremely moving. Writing for CinemaBlend, Dirk Libbey opined that every audience member would eventually cry once they discovered which character they identified with most. MovieWeb singled out Mirabel\\'s search for acceptance and a purpose, stating \"[b]uckets of tears are going to be shed\".\\n\\nRegarding \"Disney\\'s regular formula\", Encanto divided reviewers; some thought that it departed from the formula well. Forbes Scott Mendelson called the film \"terrifically unconventional\", while World critic Collin Garbarino highlighted several aspects that he recognized as deviating from the formula; such as a lack of princesses and villains, as well as the focus on community. Vulture Bilge Ebiri attributed the film\\'s enchanting qualities to the \"smaller-scale narrative\". He explained that when the Madrigals\\' inner journey is combined with the typical \"Disney spectacle\", it becomes an unexpected, \"downright Sirkian power\". Others, however, found it too similar to other Disney films. For Pittsburgh Magazine, Sean Collier felt the film was \"just another by-the-numbers Disney flick\", while Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian thought that the story \"wants to have its metaphorical cake and eat it\", deeming it contrived. :/Film Josh Spiegel thought Encanto included a mixture of formulaic aspects from many of the previous Disney and Pixar films, and failed to make them unnoticeable.\\n\\nSeveral critics also found the story unfocused. The Irish Independent Paul Whittington considered the plot \"too aimless, to satisfy anyone for long\". Alice Forman of Mashable concurred and felt several parts of Mirabel\\'s journey were arbitrary; she had a particularly negative opinion of the film\\'s middle section, which she called tedious. The Globe and Mail writer Aparita Bhandari asserted the internal, rather than external, source of conflict and several unanswered questions confused her, preventing her from immersing herself in the film. From USA Today, Brian Truitt expressed his disappointment in the third act, which he said misses Encanto focal point. David Lynch, writing for KENS, agreed, and stated the act was weak due to an underdeveloped relationship between Mirabel and Alma, as well as clumsy writing. Multiple critics also cited the film\\'s lack of villains as a detractor.\\n\\nMetacritic reported that Encanto appeared in five critic top-ten lists, including CNN and New York Daily News non-ranked lists, and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ranking (ninth). The film has also appeared on several lists of the best animated films of 2021, including those by Paste (tenth), Rotten Tomatoes (sixth), Screen Rant (non-ranked), MovieWeb (fifth), Vulture (non-ranked), and Comic Book Resources (sixth). Variety, IndieWire, Gold Derby, Entertainment Weekly, The Hollywood Reporter, Den of Geek, and the Los Angeles Times named the film the most-likely to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.\\n\\n Impact and response \\n\\nThe Denver Post journalist John Wenzel wrote, with Encanto alongside other 2021 films like West Side Story and Being the Ricardos, \"Latino voices are having a moment in U.S. cinema, injecting a diverse set of cultures long ignored by TV, books, movies, video games, stage shows and news media.\" Pamila Avila, writing for USA Today, underscored that Encanto is Disney\\'s first feature with an all-Latin American cast, capturing \"the complicated tug and pull between older and younger generations in Hispanic families.\" Roughly 25% of viewership comes from Hispanic households, while 40% of viewers are between the ages of 2 and 11.\\n\\nBillboard writer Leila Cobo said, following the success of Colombian musicians like Shakira, Maluma and J Balvin in the U.S., Colombia is \"finally seen and not just heard\" via Encanto. Cobo praised the film for not homogenizing all of the Latin American countries in the manner U.S. media has generally been, instead accurately depicting the culture unique to Colombia: \"from accents to outfits to minute details like the hand-painted tableware, the embroidered dresses, the food, the many colors of our skin, even the animals â including the ubiquitous toucan and the yellow butterflies that are synonymous with GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez.\" Johanna Ferreira of PopSugar wrote that the success of both Encanto and its soundtrack speaks to \"not just the importance and significance of this type of representation in animated films, but also how movies like this are really changing how Latinx stories are being told.\" She stated Encanto celebrates the importance of family and respect for Latin American culture, featuring \"animated stories about Latinxs written by Latinxs, with characters voiced by Latinxs, and a storyline that actually celebrates Latinxs communities rather than stereotype [Latinx].\"\\n\\nMikael Wood of Los Angeles Times stated Encanto became \"2022\\'s first widespread cultural phenomenon\", bolstered by its unique direction and music. Far Out journalist Tyler Posen called the effect \"Encanto-mania\". Various social media trends surrounding Encanto had \"people posting videos of their children recognizing themselves for perhaps the first time in the movie\\'s characters.\" Luisa\\'s physical appearance has been praised for representing muscular womenâa departure from Disney\\'s conventionally \"feminine\" depiction of female protagonists as \"small and skinny\". As of January 23, 2022, the videos tagged with the hashtag \"#encanto\" have collectively amassed more than 11.5 billion views on TikTok.\\n\\nThe film\\'s characters and their dynamics have fueled a discourse among mental health specialists, many of whom reported that their clients, especially first-generation children of immigrants, \"see themselves reflected\" in the story of Encanto and use the film to communicate \"about things that otherwise might go unsaid.\" Mirabel, Isabela, Luisa, Alma and Bruno have been the most discussed characters, with Bruno being associated with neurodiverse family members.

The attackers kill Pedro, but Alma\\'s candle magically repels them, creating the sentient Casita for the family to live within an \\'\\'encanto\\'\\', a magical realm bordered by high mountains. Fifty years later, a new village thrives under the candle\\'s protection and its magic grants \"gifts\" to each Madrigal descendant at the age of five which they use to serve the villagers. However, Bruno, vilified and [[Scapegoating|scapegoated]] for his gift of [[precognition]], disappeared ten years earlier, while Julieta\\'s youngest daughter, 15-year-old [[Mirabel Madrigal|Mirabel]], had mysteriously received no gift.\\n\\nOn the evening when 5-year-old Antonio gains the ability to communicate with animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking and the candle\\'s flame flickering, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita appears undamaged to the others. After overhearing Alma praying, Mirabel resolves to save the miracle\\'s magic. The next day, she talks to her super-strong older sister Luisa, who confesses to feeling overwhelmed by her near-constant obligations then suggests that Bruno\\'s room, in a forbidden tower in the Casita, may explain the phenomenon. There, Mirabel discovers a cave and barely escapes it with some pieces of a slab of opaque emerald glass in hand. Outside, Luisa discovers that her gift is weakening. After her family reminds her why Bruno is vilified, Mirabel reassembles the glass, and see a picture of the Casita cracking behind her.\\n\\nLater that evening, Mirabel\\'s oldest sister [[Isabela Madrigal|Isabela]], who can make plants and flowers grow at will, is scheduled to become engaged to neighbor Mariano GuzmÃ¡n. Amidst Mariano\\'s proposal and an awkward dinner, Dolores, who possesses superhuman hearing, reveals Mirabel\\'s discovery to everyone, causing the Casita to crack again, ruining the night and Mariano\\'s proposal when the weather-controlling Pepa inadvertently conjures a [[wikt:downpour|downpour]]. Amidst the chaos, Mirabel follows a group of rats and discovers a secret passage behind a portrait where she finds Bruno who reveals he never left the house and that he broke the vision to save Mirabel. Using Antonio\\'s room, Bruno reluctantly conjures another vision which initially resembles the previous one, along with Mirabel embracing Isabela.\\n\\nMirabel reluctantly apologizes to Isabela, who abruptly confesses that she does not want to marry Mariano and is burdened by her image of perfection. Mirabel helps Isabela develop her powers and the two embrace, but Alma sees the pair and accuses Mirabel of causing the family\\'s misfortunes out of spite for not having a gift. Mirabel finally snaps at Alma, blaming her overbearing nature for weakening the family\\'s magic. This argument creates a [[fissure]] that splits a nearby mountain and demolishes the Casita as the candle extinguishes, leaving the Madrigals powerless.\\n\\nSeveral hours later, Alma finds a tearful Mirabel back at the river where Pedro died and explains her tragic backstory and how, determined to preserve the magic, she ignored how her own expectations were harming the family and finally accepts responsibility for what happened. Mirabel and Alma reconcile and the two, with Bruno in tow, assemble the Madrigals to rebuild the Casita with the townsfolk joining in. Mirabel fixes a new doorknob to the main door, restoring the family\\'s gifts and reviving the house, before she and Bruno join the family for another photo.\\n\\n',\n",

              "'Encanto (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack album to Disney\\'s 2021 film of the same name. Released by Walt Disney Records on November 19, 2021, the album contains eight original songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and produced by Mike Elizondo that were recorded by various singers, and 27 score pieces composed by Germaine Franco. It has been released in 44 languages of the world, other than English and Spanish.\\n\\nTo develop the soundtrack, Miranda and team visited Colombiaâthe setting of Encantoâto study the country\\'s music. Consequentially, the album is rooted in genres such as vallenato, cumbia, bambuco and rock en espaÃ±ol, making use of the traditional music instruments of Colombia, and incorporates salsa, tango, reggaeton and bachata styles alongside pop, hip hop, folk and musical theatre elements. In the film, the songs are performed by the Madrigals, who are a multigenerational family with magical powers granted to them by a \"miracle\"; the lyrical themes revolve around individuality, self-worth, transgenerational trauma and familial love.\\n\\nThe soundtrack album was a commercial success, enjoying widespread popularity after Encantos release on Disney+. It topped the Billboard 200 chart for nine weeks, and charted all of its original songs on the US Billboard Hot 100. Elsewhere, the album reached number one in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and the top ten in various other territories. \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" by various members of the Encanto cast and \"Surface Pressure\" by Jessica Darrow have been the album\\'s best-selling tracks; the former topped the UK Singles and the US Hot 100 charts for multiple weeks, while the latter peaked at numbers four and eight, respectively. Encanto became the first Disney animated film to generate multiple top-10 Hot 100 entries. Additionally, \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" is the second number-one song for Disney in the US after \"A Whole New World\" from Aladdin (1992), and its first-ever original song to reach number one in the UK.\\n\\nUpon release, Encanto (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was met with critical acclaim and received various accolades. Reviews lauded its vibrant Latin music rhythms and complimented Miranda\\'s musicianship. The album won the Annie Award for outstanding music in a feature film, and received two nominations at the 94th Academy Awards: the film score contends for Best Original Score, and the track \"Dos Oruguitas\" by SebastiÃ¡n Yatra is competing for Best Original Song.\\n\\n Development \\nthumb|upright|alt=Lin-Manuel Miranda speaking at the 2019 San Diego Comic Con International, for \"His Dark Materials\", at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, California.|American actor, playwright and musician Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote the original songs for Encanto\\n\\nIn June 2020, American singer-songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, who had previously worked on Moana (2016), revealed that he had begun to write the music of American computer-animated musical film Encanto, which would have eight original songs in both Spanish and English, and was set for release in 2021. After the film\\'s premiere, Miranda disclosed that he had been writing songs for the film from the very beginning (that is, starting in 2016). Miranda and the filmmakers travelled to Colombia in 2018 to research and study the country, its culture and music. On September 8, 2021, Germaine Franco, co-composer of the songs from Coco (2017), began to score the film. Composer John Powell was named in the film\\'s credits as a score consultant for the music; this was the first time he had returned to work on a Disney Animation film since Bolt (2008).\\n\\n Release \\nEncanto (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released to streaming services on November 19, 2021. The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 24, 2021, in RealD 3D and Dolby Cinema. The soundtrack CDs were later made available available via Target, while picture discs were sold by Walmart. The soundtrack was released in a total 46 languages.\\n\\n Music and lyrics \\nThe soundtrack consists of 44 tracks, comprising eight original songs, their instrumental versions, an English-language version of the track \"Dos Oruguitas\" and 27 score compositions. Drawing from the diverse music styles of Colombia, the soundtrack of Encanto is a Latin-pop album combining bambuco, salsa, tango, vallenato, reggaeton, cumbia, bachata, hip hop, folk, and funk with theatre music. It incorporates the traditional music instruments of Colombia, such as marimba, accordion, tiple, tambora, guacharaca, caja and maracas. The lyrics are in English and Spanish languages, and are about the film\\'s central charactersâa multi-generational family called the Madrigals, who wield magical powers gifted to them by \"the miracle\", except the lead protagonist Mirabel Madrigal who does not possess any gift.\\n\\n Songs \\nThe opening song \"The Family Madrigal\" was inspired by \"Belle\", the opener of Beauty and the Beast (1991). It is a vallenato tune, sung by American actress Stephanie Beatriz. Mirabel introduces the Madrigals and their unique magical gifts in the song. Also performed by Beatriz, \"Waiting on a Miracle\" is a bambuco song, written as Mirabel\\'s \"I Want\" song. During the 2018 research trip to Colombia, the filmmakers noticed that local musicians in Barichara were playing Colombian music on guitars and tiples in a  waltz time signature. Miranda wrote the song in that time signature to symbolize how Mirabel is in a \"different rhythmic universe than the rest of her family\".\\n\\nThe third track, \"Surface Pressure\", is a reggaeton song with a synth-line, performed by American actress Jessica Darrow. Luisa Madrigal, one of Mirabel\\'s elder sisters, expresses her insecurities and the stress she feels from her family in the song, describing the weight of responsibility. Miranda stated he wrote the song inspired by his elder sister. \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" is an ensemble number, featuring verses by Pepa, FÃ©lix, Dolores, Camilo and Isabela Madrigal, who are Mirabel\\'s aunt, uncle, cousins, and elder sister, respectively. It is sung by Colombian singers Carolina GaitÃ¡n and Mauro Castillo, American singer Adassa, American actor Rhenzy Feliz, and American actress Diane Guerrero, respectively. \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" fuses various genres, such as salsa, guajira, Cuban folk, hip hop, and dance styles.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|last=Janin|first=Alex|date=2022-01-19|title=How \\'Encantos \\'We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\\' Became Bigger Than \\'Let It Go\\'|language=en-US|work=The Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-encantos-we-dont-talk-about-bruno-became-bigger-than-let-it-go-11642608106|access-date=2022-01-19|issn=0099-9660|archive-date=January 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125121007/https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-encantos-we-dont-talk-about-bruno-became-bigger-than-let-it-go-11642608106|url-status=live}}</ref> It sees the characters list their perspectives of Mirabel\\'s uncle, Bruno Madrigal, who became ostracized from his family after sharing unsettling visions.\\n\\n\"What Else Can I Do?\" is a \"Shakira-esque\" rock ballad. Mostly sung by Guerrero, the song sees Isabela free herself of the \"need to be perfect\". \"Dos Oruguitas\" is a violin-driven acoustic ballad. Miranda stated it was the hardest song to write and that it became his first song written entirely in Spanish-language. To make it sound like an authentic Colombian folk song, Miranda insisted on writing the song first in Spanish, rather than writing first in English and translating into Spanish later. It was recorded by Colombian singer-songwriter SebastiÃ¡n Yatra. Miranda looked to songwriters like Joan Manuel Serrat and AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim for the song\\'s inspiration. \"Dos Oruguitas\" plays when Alma Madrigal, Mirabel\\'s maternal grandmother (\"Abuela\") and the matriarch of the family, loses her husband Pedro. It is regarded as the emotional centerpiece of the album. \"All of You\" is the final musical number, sung by the entire cast. It is a culmination of melodies and musical sections from all of its preceding songs. \"Colombia, Mi Encanto\" is a non-diegetic track sung by Carlos Vives. It is an upbeat, radio-friendly dance-pop tune intended as a tribute to Colombia. It is played twice in the film: when Antonio Madrigal, Mirabel\\'s cousin, gets his gift and again from the film\\'s closing scenes to the ending credits.\\n\\n Critical reception \\nThe soundtrack was a critical success and was often acclaimed in the film\\'s reviews. Mark Kennedy of Associated Press, Edward Porter of The Sunday Times, John Lui of The Straits Times, Mini Chibber of The Hindu, Declan Burke of Irish Examiner, Whelan Barzey of Time Out, Katie Walsh of Los Angeles Times, Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun Times, Mark Feeney of The Boston Globe, Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club, Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph, and Chris Hewitt of Star Tribune have identified the music as one of the best aspects of the film. The songs have been praised for helping youngsters understand intergenerational trauma and the damage caused by repressing truth.\\n\\nthumb|upright|alt=SebastiÃ¡n Yatra singing at a 2018 concert in Babahoyo, Ecuador.|Colombian singer-songwriter SebastiÃ¡n Yatra performed \"Dos Oruguitas\", which has been named by critics as the album\\'s best song.Variety writer Davis Clayton reviewed the soundtrack as \"a quintessential sensation\" by \"all measures\". Jeremy Crabb of Screen Rant wrote \"Encantos soundtrack vividly sets the mood for this film\\'s heartfelt, animated story\", bolstered by its bold ballads and quiet, reflective songs, and picked \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" as the best song. Billboard critics dubbed \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" as the most memorable track, but picked \"Dos Origuitas\" as the best track for being a heartfelt ballad with \"emotional resonance and beautiful sentimentality\". TheWrap Drew Taylor also ranked \"Dos Oruguitas\" as the best song, and \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" as the runner-up. Francesca Steele of i stated Encanto boasts a \"dizzying\" soundtrack \"deeply woven into the characterisation\". Steele appreciated Disney for embracing a different musical direction and complex ensemble pieces and dubbed it their best music since Frozen (2013). The Independent critic Clarisse Loughrey opined that many of the tracks are characteristic of Miranda\\'s work in his musicals In the Heights or Hamilton, where \"melodies will weave in and out of each other to reach a dizzying, final climax\". Luke Goodsell of the ABC said the songs are Miranda\\'s \"seemingly inescapable sounds and \"vibrant musical numbers\", displaying the diversity of Latin music. Stephen Thompson of NPR felt the songs were lackluster.\\n\\n Commercial performance \\n\\n Albums charts Encanto (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) topped the U.S. Billboard 200 chart for nine weeks as the second longest-reigning number-one album of the 2020s decade, behind Dangerous: The Double Album (2020) by American singer Morgan Wallen. It was the first Disney soundtrack since that of Frozen II (2019) to reach the top spot, and marked the sixth time an animated film\\'s soundtrack topped the chart in its history, following The Lion King (1994), Pocahontas (1995), Curious George (2006), Frozen (2013) and Frozen II, all of which are Walt Disney productions except Curious George. Billboard reported that the soundtrack is only the third album in history to debut in one of the last four spots of the Billboard 200 (197â200) and eventually make it to number one, the others being Led Zeppelin\\'s Led Zeppelin II (1969) and the Monkees\\' Headquarters (1967).\\n\\nIt first debuted at number 197 on the Billboard 200, rose to number 110 the next week, and eventually climbed to number seven on the chart. The soundtrack reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart dated January 15, 2022, dethroning Adele\\'s 30 (2021) by earning 72,000 album-equivalent units, which comprises 88 million streams and 11,000 album sales. The next week, it slipped to number three following the debuts of Gunna\\'s DS4Ever and the Weeknd\\'s Dawn FM at the top two spots, before ascending to the number one spot once again in the following week with 104,000 units. It earned its highest consumption in its third chart-topping weekâ115,000 unitsâconsisting of 19,000 sales and 138.51 million streams. Furthermore, the album topped the US Independent Albums and Soundtrack Albums charts, and the UK Compilation Chart for multiple weeks.\\n\\nElsewhere, the album has reached number one in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, number five in Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and in the Belgian region of Wallonia, number eight in Belgium\\'s Flanders, number nine in Denmark, number 11 in Switzerland, number 14 in Germany, number 18 in Finland, number 25 in France, number 27 in Italy, and number 54 in Lithuania.\\n\\n Songs charts \\nalt=Stephanie Beatriz speaking at the 2018 San Diego Comic Con International, for \"The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part\", at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, California.|thumb|upright|American actress Stephanie Beatriz, the voice of the protagonist Mirabel Madrigal, contributes vocals to five songs.\\n\\n\"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" was the soundtrack\\'s most popular song, surging on various digital music platforms. It reached number one on the Spotify Top 50 US chart on January 10, 2022, ahead of the tracks from the Weeknd\\'s Dawn FM that was released that week, and eventually topped YouTube, iTunes and Apple Music charts. USA Today called the song \"the first breakout hit of 2022\" and a \"Frozen-style phenomenon\". According to Slate critic Chris Molanphy, \"the organic nature of the audience landing on \\'We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\\' really is the marketplace picking the single and that\\'s quite unusual, especially for an animated film\".\\n\\nAll of the album\\'s original songs appeared on the US Billboard Hot 100, led by \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\", which first appeared at number 50 and rose to number one, surpassing Frozen \"Let It Go\" (2013) as the highest charting Disney song since 1992. \"Surface Pressure\", reaching number eight, made Encanto the first Disney animated film to have generated multiple top-10 songs on the Hot 100. \"The Family Madrigal\" peaked at number 20, \"What Else Can I Do?\" at number 27, \"Dos Oruguitas\" at number 36, \"Waiting on a Miracle\" at number 48, \"All of You\" at number 71, and \"Colombia, Mi Encanto\" at number 100. Buoyed by the chart performances of the soundtrack and its songs, Miranda topped the Hot 100 Songwriters chart for the first time in his career.\\n\\nOn the UK Singles Chart, \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\", \"Surface Pressure\" and \"The Family Madrigal\" charted at numbers one, four and seven, respectively. \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" is the first-ever original Disney song to top the chart, while Encanto becomes the first animated film soundtrack to simultaneously place three songs in the chart\\'s top ten.\\n\\nIn Ireland, \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\", \"Surface Pressure\" and \"The Family Madrigal\" peaked at numbers one, eight and 19, respectively, on the Irish Singles Chart.\\n\\n Awards and nominations \\n\\nThe soundtrack; its tracks \"Dos Oruguitas\" and \"Colombia, Mi Encanto\"; Miranda; and Franco have been nominated for various awards. The film\\'s music received two Academy Award nominations at the 94th Academy Awards: Best Original Score and Best Original Song for \"Dos Oruguitas\". It also won the 2022 Annie Award for Outstanding Achievement for Music in a Feature Production.\\n\\n Impact \\n\\nthumb|upright|alt=Maluma interviewed by MTV at the red carpet of 2018 MTV Video Music Awards|Colombian singer Maluma is featured on the track \"All of You\" as the voice of Mariano Guzman.The soundtrack of Encanto was a viral phenomenon, enjoying widespread popularity on the internet. Far Out called it \"Encanto-mania\" and a \"crossover pop phenomenon\". The TikTok videos tagged with the hashtag \"#encanto\" have received more than 11.5 billion views in total, as of January 23, 2021. Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz compared \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" to the \"meteoric rise\" of Olivia Rodrigo\\'s breakthrough single \"Driver\\'s License\" in January 2021. He said \"We Don\\'t Talk About Bruno\" is propelled by high Spotify streams and trending TikTok videos like \"Drivers License\" and explained that audiences \"look for the next big thing following the usual glut of Christmas music and fall releases from major artists\". In agreement, Mikael Wood, the pop music critic of Los Angeles Times, made the same comparison and stated Encanto becoming \"2022\\'s first widespread cultural phenomenon\" has turned Miranda into a pop star and an \"increasingly powerful showbiz figure\". Wood also remarked Miranda\\'s will for \"cultural representation\".\\n\\nPatrick Ryan of USA Today cited RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) reports on Latin music revenues, which grew for a fifth consecutive year in the US in 2020, and highlighted the presence of \"Colombian hitmakers\" Maluma and SebastiÃ¡n Yatra featured on the soundtrack, summarizing \"it\\'s no wonder that Encanto has enjoyed crossover appeal\". /Film BJ Colangelo called the soundtrack \"The Biggest Thing In The World\" (on January 10, 2022), while CinemaBlend writer Rachel Romean stated the album \"has proven that it can stand on its own two feet even outside of the film\". Associated Press journalist Jake Coyle called it a pop culture sensation, saying \"the music of Encanto was suddenly everywhere. Everyone was talking about Bruno\".\\n\\nJohanna Ferreira of PopSugar\\'\\' wrote that the success of both the film and the soundtrack speaks to \"not just the importance and significance of this type of representation in animated films, but also how movies like this are really changing how Latinx stories are being told\".\\n\\n Track listing \\nAll songs are written by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Shortlists of films to compete for nominations in ten categories were announced on December 21, 2021. The nominations were announced on February 8, 2022, by actors Tracee Ellis Ross and Leslie Jordan. It will be the first time since the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 where the ceremony will feature multiple hosts.\\n\\n Ceremony information \\nDue to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, the modified eligibility criteria from the 93rd Academy Awards (such as the inclusion of direct-to-digital releases and providing flexibility for eligible theatrical runs in cities besides Los Angeles) remained in force. Because the 93rd Academy Awards had allowed a two-month extension of eligibility through the end of February 2021, only films released between March 1 and December 31, 2021 were eligible to compete in the 94th Academy Awards.\\n\\nVoting for nominations concluded on February 1, 2022. The nominations were announced on February 8, 2022, by Tracee Ellis Ross and Leslie Jordan. The ceremony is scheduled to be held on March 27, 2022, at the Dolby Theatre; an estimated 2,500 attendees expected to be present for the ceremony. It was reported that the date had been chosen as not to clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing (which ran from February 4â20, 2022), and Super Bowl LVI (which was hosted in the Los Angeles area on February 13, 2022).\\n\\nIn April 2020, the Academy announced that the Best Picture category at the 94th Academy Awards would have 10 nominees; since the 84th Academy Awards, between five and ten films have been nominated for Best Picture, based on the outcome of the ballot process. The minimum amount of original music required for eligibility in Best Original Score was reduced from 60% to 35%. Submissions for Best Original Song were capped at five songs per film. The nomination process for Best Sound introduced a preliminary round with 10 nominees. In addition, the shortlists expanded from 10 to 15 films in the categories of Best Animated Short Film, Best Documentary Short Subject, and Best Live Action Short Film.\\n\\nAs part of environmental initiatives, the distribution of screeners and other physical goods is no longer allowed; digital equivalents and streaming must now be used.\\n\\nIn October 2021, film producer Will Packer was hired to produce the ceremony. Shayla Cowan, the chief of staff of his production companies, was named co-producer. On January 11, 2022, President of Hulu Originals and ABC Entertainment Craig Erwich confirmed that the ceremony would have an assigned host for the first time since 2018. Potential hosts that were considered included Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Pete Davidson, Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez. On February 11, it was announced that the ceremony will be structured in three acts, with a different host presiding over each act, as a \"strategy to lure a broader audience and share the burden of guiding the telecast\". On February 14, Regina Hall, Amy Schumer, and Wanda Sykes were announced as the three hosts.\\n\\nMusician Adam Blackstone, who served as music director for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show, will serve as music director. He will be joined by Taryn Hurd as talent producer, David Korins as production designer, Robert Dickinson as lighting designer, and Rob Paine as supervising producer. Dave Boone, Dana Eagle, Mitch Marchand, Suli McCullough, Agathe Panaretos, Danielle Schneider, and Chuck Sklar will serve as writers, with Jon Macks as head writer.\\n\\nUnlike the previous year\\'s ceremony, which was downsized and held at a different venue with strict health and safety protocol due to COVID-19, the 94th Academy Awards will return to the Dolby Theatre with modified protocols; on February 17, 2022, The New York Times reported that the Academy will require attending nominees and guests to show proof of vaccination or a valid medical exemption, and two negative PCR tests, in order to attend. Presenters and performers will undergo ârigorous testingâ, but are not required to be vaccinated. Audience members in sections closest to the stage will be seated further apart, but not be required to wear a face mask. Masks remain required in the mezzanine. The Academy stated that this was part of a goal, alongside the film industry, to enact return-to-work standards in Los Angeles County in the wake of the Omicron surge. \\n\\nThe vaccine requirement is in line with public health orders enforced by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LAC DPH), which continue to mandate proof of vaccination for the attendees of any \"Indoor Mega Event\" (more than 1,000 attendees). In regards to its own mask mandates (which, at the time, required them for events with more than 500 attendees), Los Angeles has regulated awards shows as being a television production rather than an indoor event, thus exempting them from this mandate due to the controlled environment and other protocols adopted by the film and television industries.\\n\\n Oscars Fan Favorite \\nTo tie in with the ceremony\\'s theme of \"Movie Lovers Unite\", the Academy teamed up with Twitter to host an \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest, where Twitter users can vote for their favorite film of the year and their favorite movie moment, the two with the most votes being recognized during the telecast. Fans will be able to vote for their favorite films using the hashtags #OscarsFanFavorite and #OscarsCheerMoment, with up to 20 submissions each day per user. Films not nominated for an Academy award may also be submitted. The contest began on February 14, 2022 and ended on March 3, 2022, with the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment being announced on February 24, 2022.\\n\\nThe contest drew a mixed-to-negative reaction, with some critics viewing it as a variation of the \"Popular Film\" category proposed for the 91st ceremony, and others viewing it as a forced and rigged consolation prize to recognize Spider-Man: No Way Home and its box office performance, after Jimmy Kimmel and filmmaker Kevin Smith criticized the Academy of snubbing the film for a Best Picture nomination. The hosts of ABC\\'s The View, Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sara Haines and Ana Navarro, were among those who were critical of the contest, with Behar saying: \"We already have the People\\'s Choice Awards, where everybody weighs in on it, people on Twitter and what have you. I think it\\'s enough.\"\\n\\nMark Donaldson of Screen Rant wrote that the decision to introduce this category \"widens the gulf between Academy voters and moviegoers. For example, aside from featuring Benedict Cumberbatch in both films, The Power of the Dog is miles away from No Way Home. That\\'s how it should be, there should be room for arthouse and commercial cinema. However, Spider-Man: No Way Home winning Fan Favorite and Cumberbatch\\'s new film winning Best Picture would further entrench the divide between art and commerce within film culture\".\\n\\nOn February 18, 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Amazon/Sony\\'s Cinderella was leading the vote. Other contenders at the time included Minamata (2020), Army of the Dead, Spider-Man: No Way Home, Tick, Tick... Boom!, West Side Story, and Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League. On February 28, 2022, the Academy revealed that four of those films made the leaderboard, along with five new contenders: Dune, Malignant, The Power of the Dog, Sing 2, and The Suicide Squad. Three days later, Variety reported that Spider-Man: No Way Home was the clear favorite to win the award according to a Morning Consult survey.\\n\\nOn February 24, 2022, the contest announced the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment, which included as follows:\\n\\n Avengers Assemble â Avengers: Endgame (2019)\\n Effie White\\'s \"And I Am Telling You I\\'m Not Going\" â Dreamgirls (2006)\\n The Flash Speed Force â Zack Snyder\\'s Justice League (2021)\\n Neo Dodging Bullets â The Matrix (1999)\\n Spider-Man Team Up! â Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\\n\\n Effort to shorten the ceremony \\nOn February 22, 2022, the Academy announced that the presentations and acceptance of eight awards (Animated Short Film, Documentary Short Subject, Film Editing, Live Action Short Film, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score, Production Design and Sound) will not be broadcast live and instead be pre-taped an hour before the start of the telecast, in an attempt to \"allow more time for comedy, film clips and musical numbers,\" and shorten the ceremony; a similar move had been attempted for the 91st Academy Awards in 2019 but had been reversed after being negatively received.\\n\\nThe Hollywood Reporter later said that the decision was made under pressure from ABC executives, who had initially demanded that 12 of the 23 categories be moved off the live broadcast, under the possible penalty of not airing the ceremony at all if cuts were not made; a member of the Academy\\'s governing committee claimed that the subsequent agreement to remove eight categories was then reached after negotiations.\\n\\n Backlash \\nThe elimination of categories from the live broadcast again drew backlash, much like the similar, abandoned proposal for the 91st Academy Awards in 2019. Shortly after the decision was announced, comedian Patton Oswalt called it \"dumb and disrespectful\" to the winners of the affected awards and Variety editor Jazz Tangcay called it an \"insult to the art of filmmaking\".\\n\\nA number of individuals in the entertainment industry subsequently voiced opposition. Steven Spielberg showed his concern and disappointment with the decision in a statement, saying: \"I feel very strongly that this is perhaps the most collaborative medium in the world. All of us make movies together, we become a family where one craft is just as indispensable as the next ... I feel that at the Academy Awards there is no above the line, there is no below the line. All of us are on the same line bringing the best of us to tell the best stories we possibly can. And that means for me we should all have a seat at the supper table together live at 5.\" However, he was not optimistic that the Academy would reverse its decision, saying: \"The same thing came close to happening three years ago and at the eleventh hour a decision was made that reversed it and four categories that were in the commercial breaks were reinstated on the live show. I hope it\\'s reversed, but I\\'m not anticipating a reversal and I am not optimistic about it.\" Guillermo del Toro also spoke out at the 5th Hollywood Critics Association Film Awards, saying: \"Many of you that have a voice and that can say it should say, \\'We should not do that,\\' â¦ We shouldn\\'t do it this year. We shouldn\\'t do it ever, but this year we are together in this.\"\\n\\nSpeaking out against the Academy\\'s decision, more than 70 prominent film professionals â including James Cameron, Jane Campion, del Toro, Denis Villeneuve, and John Williams â issued a letter urging the Academy to reverse the controversial plan they argue would relegate some nominees to \"the status of second-class citizens\". Addressed to Academy President David Rubin, the letter also argues that the decision to hand out five below-the-line awards and the three short film awards in the hour before the Oscars telecast would do \"irreparable damage\" to the Oscars\\' reputation by \"demeaning the very crafts that, in their most outstanding expressions, make the art of filmmaking worthy of celebration\".\\n\\n Schedule \\n Date Event Thursday, March 17, 2022 Final voting begins Tuesday, March 22, 2022 Final polls close Friday, March 25, 2022 Governors Awards Sunday, March 27, 2022 94th Academy Awards presentation\\n\\n Nominees \\nThe Power of the Dog is the first film directed by a woman to receive more than ten nominations while its director, Jane Campion, is the first woman to receive more than one Academy Award nomination for Best Director. CODA is the first film from Apple Original Films, as well as the first starring a predominantly deaf cast in leading roles, to be nominated for Best Picture; among the cast, Troy Kotsur is the first deaf male actor to receive a nomination for an acting award (in the category of Best Supporting Actor). He is the second deaf actor overall to receive an acting nomination, after CODA co-star Marlee Matlin, who won in the Best Actress category for Children of a Lesser God (1986).\\n\\nDrive My Car is the first Japanese film to be nominated for Best Picture while its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, is the third Japanese director to be nominated for Best Director. Flee is the first film to be nominated in the categories of Best Animated Feature Film, Best International Feature Film and Best Documentary Feature simultaneously. Kenneth Branagh is the first individual to have been nominated in a total of seven different categories with his nominations in the Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay categories for Belfast.\\n\\nSteven Spielberg\\'s West Side Story is the second adaptation of the same source material for a previous Best Picture winner to be nominated for the same award, after 1962\\'s Mutiny on the Bounty. With his Best Picture nod, Spielberg is the most nominated individual in the category with eleven films. Spielberg\\'s Best Director nomination also makes him the first filmmaker to be nominated in that category in six consecutive decades. Paul Tazewell became the first African American male costume designer to be nominated for Best Costume Design for his work on the film. Paul Thomas Anderson\\'s Licorice Pizza is MGM\\'s first fully produced, marketed, and distributed film to be nominated for Best Picture in 33 years, after 1988\\'s Best Picture winner Rain Man.\\n\\nHaving starred in Don\\'t Look Up and Nightmare Alley, Cate Blanchett is the first actress in history to have credited roles in nine Best Picture nominees, surpassing Olivia de Havilland\\'s record of eight. Olivia Colman and Jessie Buckley\\'s acting nominations for The Lost Daughter mark only the third time that two individuals have been nominated for portraying the same character in the same film. The nominations of Kristen Stewart (Spencer) and Ariana DeBose (West Side Story) mark the first time that two openly LGBT actors have been nominated in the same year. This also marks the first time in which two couples are nominated in the same year, namely married couple PenÃ©lope Cruz and Javier Bardem (Cruz for Parallel Mothers; Bardem for Being the Ricardos), as well as engaged couple Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons (both for The Power of the Dog); their collective nominations span all four acting categories.\\n\\nThis ceremony also marks the first time in the preferential era and second time since the 78th Academy Awards in 2006 that all of the nominees in the Best Actress category did not star in one of the films nominated for Best Picture. It is also the first time in the award\\'s history where none of the Best Actress nominees were nominated in the same category at the 75th British Academy Film Awards.\\n\\n Awards \\n\\nWinners will be listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger (â¡).\\n\\n \\n Belfast\\xa0â Laura Berwick, Kenneth Branagh, Becca Kovacik and Tamar Thomas\\n CODA\\xa0â Philippe Rousselet, Fabrice Gianfermi and Patrick Wachsberger\\n Don\\'t Look Up\\xa0â Adam McKay and Kevin Messick\\n Drive My Car\\xa0â Teruhisa Yamamoto\\n Dune\\xa0â Mary Parent, Denis Villeneuve and Cale Boyter\\n King Richard\\xa0â Tim White, Trevor White and Will Smith\\n Licorice Pizza\\xa0â Sara Murphy, Adam Somner and Paul Thomas Anderson\\n Nightmare Alley\\xa0â Guillermo del Toro, J.
